# name: proto

# flag: flag{Prototype_for_the_win}

# solution
- The mongo id should be prediected.
- If you go back in time of 1m, you would get a directory.
- To make this Object prototype injection more fun, I add a cookie which Cyrillic "Ð°" (U+0430) rather than the ASCII "a" (U+0061)
- A post request should be made to /signup with  {"name":"World","__proto__":{"admin":1}} 
- Then navigate to /getFlag to get the flag.

#Installation
- run ./start.sh
